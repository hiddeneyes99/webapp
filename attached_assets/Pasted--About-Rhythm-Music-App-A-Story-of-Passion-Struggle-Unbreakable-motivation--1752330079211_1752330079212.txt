### 🎧 **About Rhythm Music App**

*(A Story of Passion, Struggle & Unbreakable motivation)*

**Rhythm Music** is not just an app — it’s a story carved from sleepless nights, countless failures, and one powerful reason: build something special.

I didn’t know how to build an app.
I had never written a single line of code in my life in a app development.
And yet, I dared to dream.
Why?
Because there was one person I deeply cared about.
I wanted to build something special.

### ⚙️ **The Struggle Behind the Build**

This project wasn't easy.
I failed **42 times**.
Yes, **42 full build failures** — crashing screens, broken code, corrupted files, ruined tests, and emotional breakdowns.
I even **wiped my Android phone multiple times** while testing.

For **180+ hours**, I sat in one chair, didn’t eat, didn’t sleep — with body aches and blurry eyes — just to fix what kept breaking.
There were moments I wanted to give up.
But I kept asking myself:

> *"If I can’t do this for the own dream … then what is my dream worth?"*

So I tried again.
And on the **43rd attempt**, I did it.
I beat the code. I crushed the failure. I won.
